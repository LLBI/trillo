# Trillo project
Part of my autodidactic journey and what I've managed to code up taking Udemy courses



#### Course: [Advanced CSS and SASS](http://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass)

#### Final design: Jonas Schmedtmann

#### Tools used:
- CSS and SCSS;
- BEM;
- Flexbox;

#### This was a small and simple but fully responsive project created using only CSS Flexbox.
